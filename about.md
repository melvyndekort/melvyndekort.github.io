Hello! Welcome to my blog!

My name is Melvyn de Kort and I'm a Software/Cloud engineer.
I've always been interested in new technology and new tools. In this blog I try to elaborate on the new tools and techniques that I discover and how I think they can be put to use.

As long as I've been a Software Engineer I've been trying to make my work easier and automated.
My career started in 2009 and one of the coolest tools I then discovered was a **buildserver** (Hudson at the time). It allowed me to automate my manual build cycle, how amazing! Some time later I started working with **Maven**, this allowed me to simply define my project in code and Maven would take care of the rest, even testing! Then **git** came on my path, branching was finally made easy and made all kinds of workflows possible. Several years later I started working with **Vagrant**, again the wow moment, a tool that could build a completely configured environment, and repeatable! Quickly after came **Docker**, no need to elaborate how excited I was (and still am)! Around the same time I started working with **AWS** and **Terraform**, we actually had _infrastructure as code_ at scale... I felt like I had time jumped into the future.

And then of course the technologies like RESTful web services, stateless services, no-SQL databases, client side web frameworks (JavaScript)... just mindblowing!

We're in a thrilling time when it comes to technology, we're making history every single day. When I look at what has happened in the software development industry the last decade, I can't wait to see what the next decade will bring us!
